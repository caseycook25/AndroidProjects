# AndroidProjects



#These are all projects from my Android Development class in the Spring of 2017 at CNU. 
It started off being challenging for me, but I was always able to solve the problem I was having, and it got easier as the semester went on. 
This class was before I had coding experience in a professional setting which is why my code is sloppy.
